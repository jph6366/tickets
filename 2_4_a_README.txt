=====

1.  This upgrade applies ONLY to an already-installed Version 2.4.  Install it as follows.
2.	Close your browser.  (There's no need to reboot your system.)
3.	Unzip the tickets_2_4_a_upgrade.zip file, into whatever directory you've used for Tickets.  
	These new files, 15 in all, will simply over-write their namesakes.
	
4.	That's it.  Gentlemen and ladies, Start your Browsers!

What this upgrade accomplishes for you:

1.  Tickets had been unable to accommodate multi-line descriptions in both tickets and 
	responder units.  You may or may not have encountered that, depending on what you 
	keyboarded.
2.	Something called 'frame-jumping' is now prevented.  That is, you might accidently 
	or otherwise, have entered a URL that resembled the following:    .../tickets/add.php
	(add.php being one of the files/scripts that does the 'add' function.)  This would 
	blow away all of the navigation links/buttons in the upper frame, with truly 
	inexplicable behavior.  Tickets now recovers from such an attempt - without a complaint.
3.	A number of minor fixes which, in the aggregate, cleans up some data handling - 
	particularly with dates and time values.

Guys, thanks for bearing with me on these 'challenges'.  It's truly appreciated.
