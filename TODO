TODO for PHP Ticket
-------------------

note: some of these are just suggestions, no guarantee for implementation
[x] = importance/likely to get fixed first

[5] POP/IMAP support for importing email and convert to tickets
[3] file attachment support
[4] seperate contact list, link contacts to tickets
[3] "email ticket" option for emailing the ticket data
[2] automatic purging of tickets after a date (setting)
[2] fix all do_error() output to format: "file.php::function($parameters)"
[3] restrict all user access to tickets if they're only allowed to see their own,
    meaning printing functions etc has to check for this restriction
[2] restrict settings to string/bool values etc for bugfree preferences
[1] create backends for postgresql/others?
[3] improved search capabilities
[2] maxlengths for input boxes to prevent sql errs
[2] associate ticket with others (follow-ups) with custom [ticket#1] tags?
